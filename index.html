        const facts = [
            "Octopuses have three hearts, nine brains, and blue blood, which makes them one of the most fascinating creatures in the ocean; two hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body, and each of their eight arms has a mini-brain that allows them to act independently.",
            "Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't; botanically speaking, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower with seeds embedded in the flesh, which makes bananas, cucumbers, and kiwis true berries, while strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are not.",
            "Honey never spoils, and archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible, thanks to its natural preservatives like low moisture content and acidic pH, which inhibit the growth of bacteria and microorganisms.",
            "Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures reaching up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, because Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which creates a runaway greenhouse effect.",
            "Sharks have been around for over 400 million years, making them older than dinosaurs, trees, and even the rings of Saturn; they have survived five mass extinctions and have evolved into over 500 species, ranging from the tiny dwarf lanternshark to the massive whale shark.",
            "The Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during the summer due to thermal expansion, which occurs when the iron structure heats up and the particles gain kinetic energy, causing them to move apart and the tower to expand.",
            "Wombat poop is cube-shaped, which is a unique adaptation that prevents the feces from rolling away, allowing wombats to mark their territory effectively; this peculiar shape is due to the varying elasticity of the intestines as the poop passes through.",
            "A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus; it takes about 243 Earth days for Venus to complete one rotation on its axis, but only about 225 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun, making a day longer than a year on this planet.",
            "The Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye, contrary to popular belief; while it is an impressive feat of engineering stretching over 13,000 miles, its materials and color blend with the natural landscape, making it difficult to discern from orbit.",
            "Sloths can hold their breath longer than dolphins; while dolphins can hold their breath for about 10 minutes, sloths can slow their heart rate and hold their breath for up to 40 minutes underwater, which helps them avoid predators.",
            "The human brain is the most energy-consuming organ in the body, using up to 20% of the body's total energy despite only accounting for about 2% of the body's weight, which is why maintaining a balanced diet is crucial for cognitive function and overall brain health.",

            "The Amazon Rainforest produces more than 20% of the world's oxygen, often referred to as the 'lungs of the planet,' and it is home to an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species, playing a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate.",
            "The shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896, lasting only 38 minutes, after which the Sultan of Zanzibar surrendered, marking a swift end to the conflict with minimal casualties.",
            "A group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance,' which is fitting given their vibrant pink color, which comes from the carotenoid pigments in the algae and crustaceans they eat, and their synchronized movements during courtship displays.",
            "The world's largest desert is not the Sahara, but Antarctica, which is classified as a cold desert due to its low precipitation levels, receiving only about 2 inches of snow per year, making it drier than the Sahara Desert.",
            "The mantis shrimp has one of the most complex visual systems in the animal kingdom, with 16 types of photoreceptor cells compared to humans' three, allowing them to see polarized light and detect ten times more color than humans.",
            "The longest recorded flight of a chicken is 13 seconds, which is quite impressive considering chickens are not known for their flying abilities, as they have been bred primarily for meat and egg production rather than flight.",
            "The world's largest living organism is a fungus called Armillaria ostoyae, also known as the 'honey fungus,' which covers an area of over 2,385 acres in Oregon's Malheur National Forest and is estimated to be around 2,400 years old.",
            "The blue whale is the largest animal ever known to have existed, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet and weighing as much as 200 tons, with a heart the size of a small car and a tongue that can weigh as much as an elephant.",
            "The honeybee is the only insect that produces food eaten by humans, and to make one pound of honey, bees must visit approximately 2 million flowers and fly over 55,000 miles, which is more than twice the circumference of the Earth.",
            "The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on the planet, stretching over 1,400 miles and consisting of nearly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands, and it can even be seen from space due to its massive size.",
            "The tardigrade, also known as the water bear, is one of the most resilient creatures on Earth, capable of surviving extreme conditions such as temperatures close to absolute zero, pressures six times greater than those found in the deepest ocean trenches, and even the vacuum of space.",
            "The world's oldest known 'your mom' joke is over 3,500 years old, discovered on a Babylonian tablet dating back to 1500 BC, proving that humor and playful banter have been a part of human culture for millennia.",
            "The human body contains enough fat to make seven bars of soap, and while this might sound surprising, it highlights the body's ability to store energy reserves for times of need, a trait that has been crucial for survival throughout human evolution.",
            "The moon is slowly drifting away from Earth at a rate of about 1.5 inches per year, which means that in about 600 million years, a total solar eclipse will no longer be possible because the moon will appear too small to completely cover the sun.",
            "The world's largest snowflake on record was 15 inches wide and 8 inches thick, reportedly observed in Fort Keogh, Montana, in 1887, and while this measurement is difficult to verify, it remains a fascinating anecdote about the wonders of nature.",
            "The electric eel can produce a shock of up to 600 volts, which is enough to stun a horse, and this remarkable ability is used both for hunting prey and for self-defense, making it one of the most electrifying creatures in the animal kingdom.",
            "The fingerprints of a koala are so similar to humans that they can confuse crime scene investigators, and this unique trait is shared by only a few other species, highlighting the fascinating diversity of adaptations in the animal world.",
            "The planet Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets in our solar system, completing a full rotation on its axis in just under 10 hours, which means that despite its massive size, its rapid rotation causes it to have a noticeable equatorial bulge.",
            "The world's largest pearl was discovered by a Filipino fisherman in the Palawan Sea and weighs an astonishing 75 pounds, measuring over 2 feet long, and it was kept under his bed as a good luck charm for over a decade before being revealed to the public.",
            "The human nose can detect over 1 trillion different scents, thanks to the complex olfactory system that involves hundreds of receptors, each capable of identifying a unique molecular feature, making our sense of smell incredibly nuanced and sensitive.",
            "The world's deepest postbox is located in Susami Bay, Japan, and is submerged 10 meters underwater, allowing divers to send waterproof postcards as a unique tourist attraction, highlighting the creative ways people connect with others from the depths of the ocean.",
